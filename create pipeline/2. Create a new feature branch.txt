create a new feature branch in your AWS CodeCommit repository.

In a separate browser tab, switch to the AWS Cloud9 development environment. Make sure that you are in the trivia-app directory.

cd ~/environment/trivia-app
Create a feature branch by running the following command:

git checkout -b feature-bonus-scores
You should see that you created a new branch and switched to that branch:

Switched to a new branch 'feature-bonus-scores'
